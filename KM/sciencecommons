Science Commons has three interlocking initiatives designed to accelerate the research cycle — the continuous production and reuse of knowledge that is at the heart of the scientific method. Together, they form the building blocks of a new collaborative infrastructure to make scientific discovery easier by design.

  Making scientific research “re-useful” 
    We help people and organizations open and mark their research and data for reuse. We are also exploring new models for      licensing patents and know how. http://sciencecommons.org/projects/publishing/

  Enabling “one-click” access to research materials 
    We help streamline the materials-transfer process so researchers can easily replicate, verify and extend research.

  Integrating fragmented information sources — We help researchers find, analyze and use data from disparate sources by         marking and integrating the information with a common, computer-readable language.

Science Commons in action
We implement three of these elements in the NeuroCommons, our “proof-of-concept” project within the field of neuroscience. The NeuroCommons is a beta open source knowledge management system for biomedical research that anyone can use, and anyone can build on. http://sciencecommons.org/projects/data/

NEUROCOMMONS
  
  1. Organize and Structure Knowledge
    - text mining
    - natural language processing

  2. Data analysis of Software System
