Most Common Hypothesis
  - Control Volume is steady state
  - Heat transfer to C.V to surroundings occurs at specified average outer surface temperature
  - Change in kinetic and/or potential energy between inlet and exit can be neglected
  - Gas modeled as an ideal gas, so c_p=cte

Example 6.6 Entropy Production in a Steam Turbine
  - Enlarged Control Volume

Example 6.7 Performance Claim
  -> verify conservation of mass
  -> verify conservation of energy
  -> verify second law
  -> entropy production cannot be negative
  
  Example 6.8 Entropy Production in Heat Pump Components
  -> obtain propery data of each state
  -> consider one control volume for each component
